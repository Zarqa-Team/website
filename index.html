      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Zarqa Team is an ambitious project launched by the InoNest community at
        Yildiz Technical University (YTU), an international technology-focused
        group that emphasizes practical education and innovative projects.
        InoNest empowers international students through hands-on learning
        experiences, including engineering workshops and participation in
        prestigious competitions like Teknofest. It fosters a multicultural
        environment that brings students together from diverse backgrounds to
        achieve academic excellence and drive innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zarqa Team is preparing to participate in the 2025 Teknofest Combat UAV
        Competition, where teams develop advanced unmanned aerial vehicles
        (UAVs) designed for combat simulation scenarios. We invite your esteemed
        organization to join us as a sponsor to support this remarkable journey.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="team">About the Team</h2>
      <p>
        As international students, our team members have encountered challenges
        in adapting to the Turkish academic and professional environment. Zarqa
        Team was founded to bridge the communication gap between Turkish and
        English speakers, fostering collaboration and inclusion. By primarily
        conducting research and communication in English, we get the advantage
        of recruiting members from all nationalities and having wider access to
        information. We aim to challenge our engineering abilities and academic
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team's name and logo come from the Arabian legend of Zarqaa' Al
        Yamama, a character who is said to have blue eyes and a gaze that can
        see the distance of one week, making her a pillar of defense in her
        city.
      </p>
